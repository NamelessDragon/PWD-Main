							<p class="mb-5">Early dragons will be whitelisted to a pre-sale. Every reserved whitelist will have a guaranteed mint claimable via our discord server. In order to be eligible for our whitelist going forward, there will be requirements in place:</p>
							<p class="mb-3 ml-4">1. Members will have to be level 2 in our discord (about 2 messages, no spam)</p>
							<p class="mb-3 ml-4">2. A secret link and password will be provided to you once you reach level 2</p>
							<p class="mb-3 ml-4">3. Access the link by entering the given password + your discord handle</p>
							<p class="mb-5 ml-4">4. Enter the desired wallet address (FTM compatible)  you would like to reserve the whitelist spot.</p>
							<p>This will allow us to directly import the address into our documents to avoid losing reservations. We are reserving 4,000 spots at 33 FTM for this whitelist. The goal is to give as many people the opportunity to enter this project as possible. This is special due to the fact it will deter too many “whales” from being able to mint 100+ NFTs from the start, which lowers the ratio of holders/NFTs. Any reserved whitelist spots that are not claimed, will be opened to the public for mint at 50 FTM. </p>

						<div class="accordion-content">
							<p>Powerful Dragons is an NFT collection of 5,000 unique pieces of art being built on the Fantom Blockchain. These Dragons will act as tokens that are automatically entered into our weekly giveaways of nodes from Powernode.io</p>

						<h4 class="accordion-title accordion-toggle">What is it that we Dragons want to accomplish?</h4>
						<div class="accordion-content">
							<p>The Dragon founders genuinely believe that node protocols can change lives with passive income. Initially, it was started by our founder, Pahakurki, wanting to create a financial playground for creative minds and extend an opportunity for those less fortunate so they too can be a part of the ecosystem. We understand not everybody can afford to put their hard earned dollars into one asset, and holding a Powerful Dragon enables those to win one of these assets, as well as an entry to additional projects.</p>

						<div class="accordion-content">
							<p class="mb-5">Our current plan is to take 80% of the mint revenue and invest in different UoT node protocols.</p>
							<p class="mb-3 ml-4"><i class="fa-solid fa-dragon"></i> &nbsp; 50% allocated to Powernode.io nodes for the rewards pool</p>
							<p class="mb-3 ml-4"><i class="fa-solid fa-dragon"></i> &nbsp; 50% will be invested into various Union of Transparency (UoT) node protocols. Investment strategies are as follows: 20% allocated to $Thor, 20% allocated to $Hive, and 10% to high risk/reward opportunities. These investments would be allocated to the team for future salaries, expenses, and giveaways.</p>
							<p class="mb-5 ml-4"><i class="fa-solid fa-triangle-exclamation"></i> &nbsp; Numbers are subject to change depending on the value of $Power.</p>
							<p>The remaining 20% will be used to cover upfront project costs, Assure KYC of the team, and pay the team for the hard work, time, and dedication spent for launch.</p>

					<li class="box mb-3 p-0">
						<h4 class="accordion-title accordion-toggle">How will rewards work?</h4>
						<div class="accordion-content">
							<p class="mb-5">We will use rewards earned from Powernode.io pool (with 10% going to taxes and 10% for compounding) to pass out $Power equal to that of a node (ex. 100 Super Humans make 490 $Power/week resulting in being able to give out 8 Superhumans, and 4 Human Nodes EVERY. SINGLE. WEEK.)</p>

						<h4 class="accordion-title accordion-toggle">How will the treasury be allocated?</h4>
						<div class="accordion-content">
							<p class="mb-5">We would split all treasury earnings to grow the project/team to develop further utility aside from being a “fancy giveaway tickets”. We will use the team treasury to cover node-related fees (monthly maintenance, gas, etc.), salaries, and advertising. The purpose of building the project treasury would be to have the funds needed to create merch, make any additional token purchases on significant dips, and have the funds to potentially work on a secret project(will be announced soon).</p>
